This programs in this repository are a few of the minor projects that I've built in my classes. This is not a complete
list of the projects as quite a few have been lost as at the time I did not see the value of retaining those projects 
(Most notably, my earliest projects done in C++ are near totally absent save for a few lab project which I don't 
feel comfortable uploading since our labs gave us a partially started program which we then finished, therefore the code 
is not completely my own.) Below I'll give a brief description of what each program does:

Fibonacci.py - As the name implies, this program accepts a numerical input from the user and prints out the corresponding
value of the fibonacci sequence. It calculuates the value recursively, however there is no input checking and as the values 
the user inputs grow larger the processing time escalates very quickly. This project was completed for discreet math
and was not meant to function in a stable and production quality environment, it has been included here as the fibonacci
sequence is a common programming skill test for early developers. This program was written in python 2.7

printDiscreetGraphs.py - This program allows the user to select a discreet graph, cycle graph, linear graph, or a complete 
graph, input the desired number of verticies, and then prints the graph to the screen. The program accepts the user input 
through a single char value and loops as many times as the user desires through the use of a while loop which prompts the 
user to continue or not at the end of each iteration. While there is light input validation, like Fibonacci it is by no 
means a stable program and was not required to be one under the assignment guidelines. This program was written in 
python 2.7
